# asset_management

Asset management project provides CRUD operation API's to store assets such as books, electronic components, any object. 

This project helps in organising and fetching assets. We can create asset by menitoning what type of asset, its category, where its kept. Same can be fetched by using fetch apis. Once we fetch we can get asset from its physical location. 

If asset is moved from one place to another place, we can update the asset information by using its id.

If asset is lost, or went bad and throwed out, we can delete asset  from asset_management.
## Schema
We are using CouchDB to store all the asset information. 

Below schema give the information about asset
{
    "assetId": "f09cecd2-17ad-4999-9305-b512bd50b685",  //unique id for each asset.its autogenerated uuid we can't have same asset id for more than one asset (uuid)
    "category": "book", //this is asse category, it can be books, electronic components, cloths, plants etc. (string)
    "createDate": "2023-10-06T23:22:03.480469", //when asset is create (date object)
    "description": "asset management service",  //extra information about asset.  (string)
    "location": "drawer-1A",  //where asset is kept. it can be as detailed user needs.  (string)
    "modifiedDate": "2023-10-06T23:22:03.480469", //if any update is happend on the asset info (date object)
    "name": "Design pattern by gang of four" //name for asset  (string)
}

## API specs
We are using open API specs
